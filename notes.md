#### Dependancies:
* Python 3
* fswebcam

* the user is part of the video group

#### Make sure the *install.sh* script checks for the dependancies and asks the user if they want to install them.

#### Scripts (tick when done):

- [x] usb-photo.py - the main program that takes the photo
- [x] usb-photo - the script that the user calls from cmd line
- [x] install.sh - the setup script that installs dependancies and the other files.
